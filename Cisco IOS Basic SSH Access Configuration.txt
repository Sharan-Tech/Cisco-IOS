Cisco IOS Basic SSH Access Configuration

The below config enables the ssh to connect to the cisco based switches/routers securely. 
SSH Operates on port 22 and the encryption/decryption of the communications is done by the public and private keys we generate. 

This config is of two phases. 

1. Configuring the SSH
2. Configuring the IP Parameters for the device management. 

() -> explanation of the commands. 

***************************

1. Configuring the SSH

Login to the Console port. 

enable (entering privilege mode)
conf t (entering global configuration )
hostname myswitch01
ip domain-name domain.com (replace it with your domain server, this is required for the generation or RSA Keys. )
crypto key generate rsa (generating a RSA Key)
2048 (size of the key , the default is 512, but larger the number, the more secure)
username admin privilege 15 secret password (Here the privilege 15 means the highest level of access)
line vty 0 4 (vty means virtual teletype and the numbers specify the range. In this case there can be 5 simultaneous ssh connections to the switch).
transport input ssh
privilege level 15
ip ssh version 2
login local
end 
wr

***************************

2. Configuring the IP Parameters for the device management. 

The above config enables the SSH feature in the Cisco Devices. Now we have to configure the IP Parameteres, to make the switch accessible over the network. 

	1. specify an interface, typically a management interface. 
	2. Create a SVI 
		conf t
		interface vlan 2 
		description **MGMT VLAN** 
		ip address x.x.x.x y.y.y.y (x - ip, y - netmask)
		no shutdown 
		exit
		ip default-gateway x.x.x.x (specify the IP of the gateway of the management network)
		interface gi0/0/0 (select the interface you want to be the management interface)
		switchmode mode access
		switchport access vlan 2 (Creating a L2 VLAN which would be bridged into the SVI of interface VLAN 3)
		no shutdown
		end

		wr mem 

Now the switch will be reachable via SSH over the IP you specify in the phase 2 config on the management network.
